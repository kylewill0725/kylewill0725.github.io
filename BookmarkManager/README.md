It is just an ordinary bookmark storage (currently in development, it is my pet project, so ;p). More info below.

## Features that I will implement in the future:
* ~~Making the whole thing work, OF COURSE! (being actually able to store, retrieve, and manipulate data)~~
* More things on each item and make those things into some kind of an object (so that I can at least get a hands-on experience on manipulating those types of data)
* A more stylized finish on the page

## Why it is  not finished?
Mostly because I'm a LVL 1 Web Developer... oh wait, I can't even call myself a web developer yet. ;p

This is mostly a test of what I've learned during my self-learning process especially in JavaScript so development is going to be painstakingly slow.

## Some notes on this one
In case something has gone wrong, you can basically reset the entire thing by deleting your browser data that is associated with it.
